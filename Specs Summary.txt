Title: MyFarm


Questions:
	- Advancing and progression via days or minutes
	- Fertilizer either happening before or after planting
	- Plow or Shovel removing withered plants
		~ Plow paying either 10% or 2 OC to remove
	- Withered crop stays indefinitely or x2 Harvesting time
	- Harvest Exp Gain





I. Premise
	Discount Stardew Valley with only Farming





II. Possible Actions In A Day

	1. Buy Seeds
	2. Prepare / Plow Land
	3. Planting Seeds
	4. Advancing Days / Wait Crops Grow
	5. Harvesting Crops





III. End Conditions
	- Can go on until forever until:
	
	A. 
		1. No growing or active crops
		2. No money for seeds
		
	B. 
		1. Farm only contains withered crops
		2. No money to use shovel tool





IV. Starting Equipment
	1. 10 by 5 farm plot
	2. 0 seeds
	3. 5 fertilizer
	4. 100 Objectcoins
	5. Farmer Level 0





V. Farming Process
	1. Starting farm only has unplowed tiles at the start
	2. Farmer needs to plow land using plowing tool
	3. After plowing, has option to plant seeds or fertilize
	4. After plant seed, has option to water
	5. Plants stay on the tile forever unless harvested
	6. Plants will wither if not taken care of
		- If withered, then tile cannot be used anymore
	7. Crop can be harvested after passed minimum requirements and time
		- If missed harvest time, crops become withered
	8. Harvested crops return n number of produce and are automatically sold for coins
		- Number of produce depends on crop
	9. Farmer earns Farming XP from successfully grown crops
	10. After harvesting, tile will be converted back to unplowed tiles
	




VI. Rocks

	A. Rock Mechanics
		- Rocks are scattered around the 10x5 farm at first
		- Rocks prevent any action on the tile apart from remove rock
		- Removing rock requires using pickaxe tool that costs 50 Objectcoins
			~ After removal, tile becomes an unplowed tile
	
	B. Rock Generation
		- Rock generation is gotten from a file input
		- File is read at the start of the game
			~ Assume input file is always valid format
		- Can be any rock formation
			~ Limited to 10 - 30 rocks





VII. Withered Crops

	A. Removing Withered Crops
		- Withered crops stay on the tile forever unless using shovel tool
		- Shovel tool requires 7 Objectcoins to be used to remove withered crop
		- Shoveled withered crops convert to unplowed tiles
	
	B. Using Shovel Outside of Intended Purpose
		- All actions require 7 Objectcoins
		1. Using Shovel to a unplowed tile does nothing
		2. Using Shovel on a crop tile will remove the plant and make the tile unplowed





VIII. Farm Progression
	
	A. Level Mechanics
		- Player gains a specific amount of XP per harvested crop
		- Player start with 0 XP
		- After enough XP, Player will level up
		- Player levels up in increments of 100
		
	B. Farm Registration
		- After certain levels, player can register their farm
		- Registration is not automatic
			~ Players need to manually register
		- Registration has a cost but brings benefits
			~ Some benefits include increase harvest price and spending less for purchases
				*** Consider this for the Crop Price
		- Registration has 4 tiers at level 0, 10, 15, 20





IX. Farming Tools
	
	A. Watering Can
		- Water a crop tile
		- Has infinite water
	
	B. Plow
		- Prepares a tile for plating
		- Removes withered plants for 2 OC ?????
	
	C. Shovel
		- Removes withered plants for 7 OC
	
	D. Pickaxe
		- Removes rocks for 50 OC
	
	E. Fertilizer
		- Fertilizes a tile
		- Bought in finite amounts
			~ Costs 10 OC
		- Player starts with 5 fertilizers
		- Must be placed on a plowed tile
			~ Cannot be placed on a plant tile





X. Player Vision
		
	A. Farm Field
		- Place to plant crops
		- Is 10 by 5 tiles big
		- All tiles are at first unplowed or has rocks
		- Player should be able to see each tile and its status
		- Statuses:
			unplowed
			rocks
			plowed
			fertilized
			watered
			occupied by crop
			occupied by withered crop
	
	B. Player Inventory
		- Should display tools and seeds
	
	C. Tool Tips
		- An area that shows status of selected objects
		1. Select Tile
			- Show information and status of tile
		2. Select Tool
			- Shows tool information and tool options
		3. Select Seed
			- Shows seed information and options to either plant or buy more





XI. Seeds
	- Grows into crops
	- Each seed takes 1 tile
		~ Except Fruit Trees
	- Different crops have different needs of water, fertilizer, and time
	
	A. Crop Types
		1. Vegetables
		2. Flowers
			- Have crop bonus cuz they are pretty
		3. Fruit Trees
			- All adjacent tiles should not have crops
	
	B. Crop Stats
		1. Seed Name
			- Name of the Crop
		2. Crop Type
			- Type of plant the crop is
		3. Harvest Time in Minutes
			- How long it takes to harvest the crop
			- Crops need to be harvested within a minute of being ready
				~ Else withers
		4. Water Needed
			- Minimum times watered to yield
			a. Bonus Limit
				- Limit for Water Bonus
		5. Fertilizer Needed
			- Minimum fertilizers used before planting to yield
			a. Bonus Limit
				- Fertilizer for Fertilizer Bonus
		6. Harvest Cost
			- Cost to harvest the Crop
		7. Number of Produce Produced
			- n Number of Produce Produced per harvest
			- Immediately sold upon harvest
		8. Seed Cost
			- Price to buy the seed
		9. Base Selling Cost per Piece Produced
			- Base Selling Cost of each piece of produce
	
	C. Crop Product Selling Price Equation
		- Indicates the actual selling price of an individual crop's produce
				sp = flb + bp + wb + fb + cb
			~ sp  : Selling Price
			  flb : Farmer Level Bonus
			  bp  : base price
			  wb  : water bonus
					wb = times watered * 0.25 * bp
			  fb  : fertilizer bonus
					fb = fertilizers used * 0.50 * bp
			  cb  : crop bonus (Only for flowers)
					cb = 0.05 * (bp + wb + fb)
	
	D. Harvesting
		- If water and fertilizer needs are not met at the time of harvesting they will not produce a produce and will wither
		- Products disappear after 1 minutes of not harvesting and the crop will wither
		- Player is alerted if success or failure of harvest, produced products, and how much profit
		- A withered crop stays on the tile for the duration of x2 crop's Harvest Time ???
			~ To remove withered crop, pay 10% of Seed Cost to the plow tool
