Questions:
	- 

Considerations:

	- New Class for Farmer Title
	- Farmer Title being an int
		~ With a getString method
	- Method that shows what to display

	Discount Stardew Valley with only Farming





II. Possible Actions In A Day

	1. Buy Seeds
	2. Prepare / Plow Land
	3. Planting Seeds
	4. Advancing Days / Wait Crops Grow
	5. Harvesting Crops





III. End Conditions
	- Can go on until forever until:
	
	A. 
		1. No growing or active crops
		2. No money for seeds
		
	B. 
		1. Farm only contains withered crops
		2. No money to use shovel tool





IV. Starting Equipment
	1. 10 by 5 farm plot
	2. 5 fertilizer
	3. 100 Objectcoins
	4. Farmer Level 0





V. Farming Process
	1. Starting farm only has unplowed tiles at the start
	2. Farmer needs to plow land using plowing tool
	3. After plowing, has option to plant seeds
	4. After plant seed, has option to water or fertilize
	5. Plants stay on the tile forever unless harvested
	6. Plants will wither if not taken care of
		- If withered, then tile cannot be used anymore
	7. Crop can be harvested after passed minimum requirements and time
		- If missed harvest time, crops become withered
	8. Harvested crops return n number of produce and are automatically sold for coins
		- Number of produce depends on crop
	9. Farmer earns Farming XP from successfully grown crops
	10. After harvesting, tile will be converted back to unplowed tiles
	




VI. Rocks

	A. Rock Mechanics
		- Rocks are scattered around the 10x5 farm at first
		- Rocks prevent any action on the tile apart from remove rock
		- Removing rock requires using pickaxe tool that costs 50 Objectcoins
			~ After removal, tile becomes an unplowed tile
	
	B. Rock Generation
		- Rock generation is gotten from a file input
		- File is read at the start of the game
			~ Assume input file is always valid format
		- Can be any rock formation
			~ Limited to 10 - 30 rocks





VII. Withered Crops

	A. Removing Withered Crops
		- Withered crops stay on the tile forever unless using shovel tool
		- Shovel tool requires 7 Objectcoins to be used to remove withered crop
		- Shoveled withered crops convert to unplowed tiles
	
	B. Using Shovel Outside of Intended Purpose
		- All actions require 7 Objectcoins
		1. Using Shovel to a unplowed or rock tile does nothing
		2. Using Shovel on a crop tile will remove the plant and make the tile unplowed





VIII. Farm Progression
	
	A. Level Mechanics
		- Player gains a specific amount of XP per harvested crop or using tool
		- Player automatically levels up
		- Player start with 0 XP
		- After enough XP, Player will level up

	B. Farm Registration
		- After certain levels, player can register their farm for a fee
		- Registration is not automatic
			~ Players need to manually register with a fee
		- Registration has a cost but brings benefits
			~ Bonous Ernings per Produce
			~ Seed Cost Reduction
			~ Water Bonus Limit Increase
			~ Fertilizer Bonus Limit Increase
				*** Consider this for the Crop Price
		- Registration has 4 tiers at level 0, 5, 10, 15
			~ Farmer (default)
			~ Registered Farmer
			~ Distinguished Farmer
			~ Legendary Farmer

X. Player Vision
	- Given the freedom to implement how the player interacts with the game
	- Player interacts with tiles 
		~ View tile information and in interact with tiles
	- The player views their current experience/level
	- The player can register for the next farmer type
	- The player can proceed to the next day
	- Player don’t have enough money to use the pickaxe, the player should be informed. 
	- If a player harvests a crop successfully, they should be informed of the details of the harvest
	- Prioritize functionality over form / style





XI. Seeds
	- Grows into crops
	- Each seed takes 1 tile
		~ Except Fruit Trees
	- Different crops have different needs of water, fertilizer, and time
		~ Will wither otherwise
	
	A. Crop Types
		1. Root Crop
		2. Flowers

		2. Crop Type
			- Type of plant the crop is
		3. Harvest Time in Minutes
			- How long it takes to harvest the crop
			- Crops need to be harvested within a minute of being ready
				~ Else withers
		4. Water Needed
			- Minimum times watered to yield
			a. Bonus Limit

				~ No more inventory
				~ Immediately deducted from wallet
		8. Base Selling Cost per Piece
			- Base Selling Cost of each piece of produce
		9. Experience Yield
			- Experience gained after harvesting
	
	C. Crop Product Selling Price Equation
		- Indicates the actual selling price of an individual crop's produce
				FinalHarvestPrice = HarvestTotal + WaterBonus + FertilizerBonus
			~ HarvestTotal = ProductsProduced x (BaseSellingPricePerPiece + FarmerTypeEarningBonus)
			~ WaterBonus = HarvestTotal x 0.2 x (TimesCropWasWatered – 1)
			~ FertilizerBonus = HarvestTotal x 0.5 x TimesCropAddedFertilizer
		- Flowers have a bonus added to them
			FinalHarvestPrice = FinalHarvestPrice * 1.1
			
	
	D. Harvesting
		- If water and fertilizer needs are not met at the time of harvesting they will not produce a produce and will wither
		- Products disappear after 1 minutes of not harvesting and the crop will wither
		- Player is alerted how much produced products, and how much profit
			~ Also alerted if crop withers
